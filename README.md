**Task 5 – Neural Style Transfer**  
**Internship:** Generative AI – Prodigy Infotech

---

## 📝 Description

This task implements **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** using deep learning. The goal is to create a new image that blends the **content of one image** (e.g., a photograph) with the **artistic style of another** (e.g., a painting). A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), typically **VGG19**, is used to extract features and optimize a stylized output through iterative training.

- Python  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Pre-trained VGG19 model  
- NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL  
- Google Colab / VS Code
